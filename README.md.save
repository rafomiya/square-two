Project of a virtual store, made with HTML, CSS and PHP. Deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
The current progress of the project can be seen [here](https://square-two.herokuapp.com/).


## Requirements:

- Composer package manager.
- A [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/login).



<hr>

## Starting with Heroku:

​	Assuming you already have the Heroku CLI installed, log in through the command line:

```bash
heroku login -i
```

​	Creating the application on the project root:

```bash
cd <project_folder>
heroku create
```

<hr>

## Project dependencies:

​	We need a `composer.json` file on the root of the application, declaring each dependency of our project on the `require` key. 
​	e.g.:

```JSON
{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "1.0.*@beta",
        "php": "^7.4.0"
    }
}
```

​	If the project doesn't have any dependencies, it will still need a `composer.json` file, containing only `{}`. That's how Heroku recognize which runtime to use.

​	After that, execute `composer update` on the command line, so the app can run locally. This command will also generate a `composer.lock` file, responsable for "locking" the dependencies.

> OBS: Commit the changes in each step of the development :)



<hr>

## `Procfile`:

​	The next step is to create a `Procfile` on the root directory of our project. This file, that has no extension, will instruct Heroku on how to start the application. To do so, create the file and write the following:

​	```web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2```

### Document root

​	The document root is the directory where the `.php` files are located. It is possible to change that on the `Procfile`, adding the path to the end of the line:

​	```web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/```

​	In this example, the document root is the `public` directory.

> OBS: Usually, the `vendor` directory contains sensitive data of our project. It must be always on the `.gitignore`, for security reasons :).I learned this the hard way :sweat_smile:.




<hr>

## Environment variables

​	Sensitive data, such as passwords or tokens, must be kept in a safe way. Therefore, we use environment variables, that can't be seen on the source code, but can be accessed through special methods, like `getenv()`.

### `heroku config` command

​	Using Heroku, it is really easy to set the env vars through the command line:

```bash
heroku config:set VAR_NAME=VAR_VALUE
```

​	If we want to define `123` as `PASSWORD`:

```bash
heroku config:set PASSWORD=123
```

​	To verify them:

```bash
heroku config
```

> Warning! Don't give too generic names to your environment variables. They could be overrid by predefined Heroku varables. I learned this the hard way :sweat_smile:.



<hr>

## Deploy

​	Now that we're all set, we can finally deploy. But before we do that, verify if all files containing sensitive data are on the `.gitignore`. If you don't know what it is, check it out [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files). After that, run:

```bash
git add . # adding the files to commit
git commit -m "<commit_message>" # commiting
git push heroku main # deploying
```
